# GameJamGum
This game was made for a game jam with the theme of "bubble gum."
Inspired by Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda for the NES, this game has you exploring a dungeon, fighting enemies, collecting items, and solving puzzles. <br />
Thought went into designing enemies and items to work with the bubble gum theme. The player will find a special type of ammo that can stick enemies in place. <br />
There are three different enemy types: a normal enemy, an armored enemy, and a shield enemy. <br />
Normal enemies can be defeated with the normal gumball ammo the player starts out with. <br />
The armored enemies can't be damaged until the player uses a bubble bomb to blow off the protective armor. <br />
The enemies with shields require the player to find a way around the big shield they carry. You must either stick them in place witht he sticky ammo and get behind them, or utilize bombs to damage them.
